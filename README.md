# Hi, Iâ€™m Jeffrey Helder

### Why Is My Github so Bare Now?
I did some spring cleaning! I kept some original repo's from when I started learning web development, for sentimental reasons of course, then I cleared out all the unfinished/partial projects, then I got rid of all the projects that I feel don't reflect how I code now. So.. that was a lot.  
**Starting fresh.** Now moving ahead, I want to dedicate my GitHub page to my personal projects.
