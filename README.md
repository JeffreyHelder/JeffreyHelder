# Jeffrey Helder
Web Developer & Digital Strategist

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Jeffrey Helder, a passionate web developer and digital strategist. My expertise lies in crafting digital success stories using a variety of technologies and tools. Here's a glimpse into what I do:

## Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: TypeScript
- **Frontend Frameworks & Libraries**: React.js, Next.js, Gatsby.js
- **Backend Tools**: Firebase & Google Cloud Platform, Misc. BaaS platforms
- **UI Libraries**: Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Chakra UI
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS, SCSS, CSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Other Tools**: Webflow, Framer, Wordpress + Breakdance, FlutterFlow, Vercel
- **Black List**: Wix, Host Gator. (I know they might be ok for some, I simply do not like them)

## Design
I use Figma for all my web design and when I need something a little more powerful to do quick edits I use Photopea. I am considering using the Affinity suite since they look like great alternatives to Photoshop & Illustrator.

*I started with the AdobeCC, but since my graphic design days are few and far between I opted to cancel my subscription. I do miss AfterEffects. Annd I'm an honest man so pirating any of them just doesn't feel right to me.*

## Project Management
I used to use Asana, Bitbucket, & Harvest at my desk job, but once I went freelancing I used Trello, tried Monday but my PM quickly turned into email chains. I know, I know, it stresses me out too.
- **Version Control**: Github
- **Project Management**: Trello, Monday

## About Me

I'm not just a web developer; I'm a digital strategist. I thrive on finding solutions to help businesses and individuals succeed in their digital efforts. I've studied UI & UX theory and have been practicing web design since before I was developing. Recently, I have been expanding my horizons by exploring website builders, digital marketing, backend solutions, and much more fun stuff. Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect UIs, diving into UX strategy, going deep into frontend development, or finding solutions to problems I never thought of, I'm always eager to explore new paths to digital success.

## Interests & Hobbies

- **Coffee**: Like a typical developer, I fill my day with coffee and I truly appreciate a good cup.
- **Animal Guy**: I have a huge soft spot for animals, and my social feeds are filled with animal reels. Currently, I have a black cat named Theo, as well as four lizards and a snake at home.
- **Beer Enthusiast**: What can I say, I enjoy a good craft beer or a classic Pabst after work.
- **DIY Project**: When I'm not coding, there's a good chance I'm working on DIY home improvement projects.
- **Cars**: I tell everyone I don't like working on cars, but the truth is I do. I just don't like that I have to work on my car because it's always falling apart.

## My 5 Year

Over the years, my aspirations have matured. I once was obsessed with starting my very own Dev Studio, whereas now I'm hooked on helping non-tech-savvy individuals succeed digitally.
- **Professional Goal**: I want to continue growing as a developer, but with a more focused path. My goal is to work for an established company where I master their tech stack and grow into a senior position where I can give direction and coach new developers.
- **Personal Goal**: I want to build a community for early entrepreneurs and individuals where I can help simplify and breakdown how they can succeed in their digital efforts. From online advertising to building a website, getting their emails set up, having a phone system, email marketing, and so on.
- **Dev Goal**: My next big project that is full of new learning experiences for me is creating a simple platform where members of this community can easily manage all of these digital aspects from one dashboard.
