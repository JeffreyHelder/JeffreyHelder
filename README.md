# Hi, Iâ€™m Jeffrey Helder
Full-time Web Developer

### About
My main goal is to work my way up to be a Software Engineer, but that doesn't happen overnight! <br />
Checkout my website to see my non-stop progress!

#### I'm a full-time intermediate web developer
This means I get to work with web technologies everyday such as: <br />
-React <br />
-Typescript <br />
-Javascript <br />
-UX design and strategy <br />
-UI and web design <br />

To summarize, I make a bunch of flow charts, design files, and frontend + styling code.

#### On my spare time
- I do a lot of courses, tutorials, and self teaching after work and on weekends
- I love playing video games when I can
- Music, Netflix & Anime
- I am a fan of craft beers (stouts and coffee porters are my favorite)
- And finally I've recently taken up media-creation as a hobby

### Closing 
My goal every night is to be better than I was that morning. A day without learning is a day wasted. <br />
Coffee.
